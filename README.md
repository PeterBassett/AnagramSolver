Anagram Solver

A fun little solver for a few online word games.

It does anagrams using a Trie structure of all english words and permutations of the selected input letters.

It can also solve clues from a little game called "Wordalot" which is a cross between a crossword and an anagram.

Just a bit of fun. Includes a command line tool as well as a SignalR website.
